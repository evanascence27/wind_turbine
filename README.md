README: IBM Hack Task

Project title
Wind Turbine Time Series Analysis and Energy Prediction

Motivation
Built as a group task for IBM Hack 2020. It has 3 features:
1.Time Series Analysis and Forecast
2.Parameter input through GUI interaction
3.Active Power Prediction for given input

Coding Language
Python 3.7(64 bit)

Tech/framework used
The following are the prerequisites of system to run the python files. They can be run on Jupyter or Google colab.
1.Python 3.7
2.Jupyter Notebook 3.7.3 [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] 
3.Keras 2.4.3(tensorflow 2.2 or higher backend)
4.Keras-Preprocessing 1.1.2
5.matplotlib 3.2.1
6.numpy 1.18.3 
7.pandas 1.0.3
8.pip 20.1.1
9.scikit-learn 0.22.2.post1
10.scipy 1.4.1 
11.seaborn 0.10.1
12.tensorboard 2.2.2
13.tkcalendar 1.6.1 
14.tkinter
15.PIL 7.2.0



Features
The proposed solution is to build a predictive model to calculate the effective instantaneous energy output, accounting for these factors, at any given point of time, so that the resources required for production (for example the fuel, 2 manpower, maintenance) and overall cost of production can be reduced to a minimum. Machine learning models being proposed here, are an instance of the realtime technology being put to use for the same. 

Run
Run driver.py file to test the system. The user enters the various parameters in the corresponding boxes. Once the Submit button is pressed, the ML model runs in the backend and predicts the Active Power for the corresponding parameters from its learned values. Once the user has done viewing the output, he can click on Finish and the window will close. The data entered and the predicted Active Power is constantly updated into the dataset.
